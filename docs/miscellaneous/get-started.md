# Get Started

To get started on JSONClasses is quite easy as it designs. In less than several
minutes, you can get your first JSONClasses server running.

## Setup Dependencies

JSONClasses requires [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org). If you don't have
it installed, you can follow the download guide
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

JSONClasses uses MongoDB for its ORM feature. In the future, SQL databases will
be supported. But for now, the only supporting database is MongoDB. If you don't
have it installed, you can download it [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

## Install

Read the [installation guide](./installation) to create a starter JSONClasses server project.
